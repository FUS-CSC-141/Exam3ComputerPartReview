# TODO: 1.
#
#   The todos in this module are in one comment because you will be modifying
#   the same bit of code each time. Here you will create a form for someone to
#   leave a rating on a product.
#
#   For this _todo_, you will create a window with the title "Rate Product" and
#   call its mainloop() method so it runs.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
#
#
# TODO: 2.
#
#   For this _todo_, you will create an area for the user to select a rating.
#   There should be a label that says "Rating:" and below it 5 buttons (1-5)
#   all next to each other for the user to press to indicate their rating. Each
#   button should be the same size as the others. I used 50px by 50px.
#
#   HINT: I used a frame to surround the buttons and grid for this.
#
#   All of the elements on this window should be centered.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
#
#
# TODO: 3.
#
#   For this _todo_, create two more labels: one that says "Current Rating:"
#   and another that starts out empty beneath it. This is where the current
#   rating that the user has selected will display.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
#
#
# TODO: 4.
#
#   For this _todo_, create another label that says "Feedback" and a multiline
#   entry box where the user can type some feedback.
#
#   The multiline entry box should have a default width of 10 and height of 15,
#   but it should fill to the left and right if the window is resized.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
#
#
# TODO: 5.
#
#   For this _todo_, using the command keyword on each button to have each
#   number button change the current rating to that number. Pressing each
#   button should change the text of the empty label from before.
#
#   HINT: I found that the easiest way to accomplish this was to use a
#   different handler for each button.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
